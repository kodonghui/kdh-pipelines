# UI Verification

## UI Verification (triggered when UI files changed)

### Detection
UI files changed = any modified/added file matching:
- `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.jsx`, `**/*.vue`, `**/*.svelte`
- `**/*.css`, `**/*.scss`, `**/*.less`
- `**/*.html` (in src/ or app/ directories)
- Route/page config files

### Full Interaction E2E

```
Step 1: Start dev server (dev_command from project-context.yaml, 60s timeout)
Step 2: Identify changed pages (git diff → filter UI → map to routes)
Step 3: Playwright screenshot of ALL changed pages
Step 4: Full interaction E2E on each changed page:
  a. Every button: click → verify no crash + expected response
  b. Every input: type test data → verify value + validation
  c. Every form: fill + submit → verify success/error states
  d. Every dropdown: open → verify options → select → verify
  e. CRUD operations (if applicable): create → read → update → delete
  f. Console errors: capture all, filter benign, fail on unexpected
Step 5: Theme consistency check (design tokens match app shell)
Step 6: Router import check (all lazy-loaded routes resolve)
Step 7: Stop dev server
```

If Playwright not configured → skip automated E2E, still run router + console checks.
